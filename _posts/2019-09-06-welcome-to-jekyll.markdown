The old site was made in Octopress, but I noticed that system looks abandoned.
Since Jekyll version 4 was released some days ago I decided to migrate it.
Hopefully, in the next few days I will apply a nice theme & plugins and start adding some posts.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

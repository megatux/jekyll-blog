Cristian Molina wanted to be a programmer since he saw the first games on an [Atari2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) clon. Later he started hacking with Basic, then C, and later, Java. In the 2000's he worked mostly with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) developing web applications at companies in a wide range of industries from media, to communications, transportation, banking and finance. After making the switch to full-time Ruby development in 2011, he's enjoying learning more about the [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) and its ecosystem as well as other newer web technologies. A long time Free Software and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) advocate, Cristian enjoys digging into the deeper technical aspects of programming languages and operating systems.

The other big passion he has is _running_. Most of his free time he's planing and training for his next ultra trail race.

He is also a [vegan♥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism) and a cat lover<i class="nes-icon is-small heart"></i>.
